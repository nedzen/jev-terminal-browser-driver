# Live-test learnings ledger

One row per run, appended by `scripts/live`. `outcome` is the v3.1 partition
(HIT / HIT-recovered / MISS / FALSE-DONE / BLOCKED-honest / BLOCKED-unjustified /
STALL / CRASH); `sev` is sev-1 (FALSE-DONE only, must stay 0) or sev-2. `bytes/call`
is the caller-ingested gate; driver Jev token totals are diagnosis only. Slices:
`/tmp/wwwdrive-runs/<run_id>.jsonl`. S6x rows carry presence-only values, never
amounts.

Columns: `url` is final_url on host+path only, `waste` is measured waste-ticks
(post-satisfaction + stale retries only -- the remainder has no oracle), `commit`
is abbreviated to 7. A `void` row is a CRASH retry attempt and does not count
toward the scoreboard. Free-text notes are in the run record and the JSONL slice,
not in this table: a wrapping paragraph in a ledger cell is unreadable.
